An application template which allows users to log in and reach private pages of your website. The application uses PHP, MySQL and jQuery. You will need to change the values within classes/config.ini to the ones matching your database and server. You should also consider adding a .htaccess file to the classes directory with the line:
deny from all

Will soon be changed to use the PDO version of the database class.
